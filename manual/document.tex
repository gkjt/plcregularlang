\section{Introduction}
\begin{normalsize}
LangLang is a small, imperative, weakly typed language for handling basic manipulations of regular languages. It is very easy to learn, with only 3 primitive types and 9 command symbols. Input is read on stdin before the program is executed, where it can then be accessed like a buffer, more in section \ref{sec_input}

\section{The Basics}
\subsection{Hello World}
\label{helloworld}
\begin{normalsize}
So we are very proud to say that LangLang is capable of outputting strings to Standard Output. Yes, a great feat, we know, we know! It works as you would expect, as shown in the following code snippet:

print "hello";

So lets break this down:

The print command comes in two flavours, with one argument or with two. In this case we are using 1 argument, which will just print out all of the argument, whatever it is. It will take any of our primitive types, or you can pass it a variable name and it will print out the value of that variable. See the reference for the print command in section \ref{print}.
