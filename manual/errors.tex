\subsection{Errors}
\begin{normalsize}
LangLang has a very simple error system, syntax errors and type errors.

Syntax errors are for when you type something in that is not a valid LangLang token, and can occur in both the input and the program. The error message for a syntax error contains the line and column number for where the token that cause the error was, and the token that caused the error. Note that the token may be a newline or absence of a different token (ie. End of file before a semicolon on a previous statement), however it will still tell you where it is so you can easily see the issue.

Type errors occur when the expression is made up of valid tokens, but one or more of the tokens are the wrong type for the function. In this case a message describing how the offending function should be used is provided, so you can find the problem and fix your program.
